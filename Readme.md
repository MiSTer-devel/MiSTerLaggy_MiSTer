# MiSTer Laggy

MiSTer Laggy is a display latency tester for use with the MiSTer FPGA system. It consists of a core that runs on the MiSTer DE-10 and a light sensor that connects to the MiSTer's User Port. It operates on the same principle as the [Time Sleuth](https://github.com/chriz2600/time-sleuth) but takes advantage of an existing platform to generate the video signal and capture the measurements.
